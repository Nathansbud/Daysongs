# Daysongs

Songs for specifically today!

## Criteria

In order to count as a true daysong, a track must either:

- Be named for a specific date (not simply recorded that day)
- Reference a specific date in its lyrics

Holidays (including floating ones like Easter) are permitted, as are specific dates (i.e. those with years), such as [Huit octobre 1971](https://open.spotify.com/track/2CsnpBAB8VQMTyPuws57ao?si=03396b5ee504433e) or [21/04/20](https://open.spotify.com/track/3a6Bj474rn6AGwRGgNBFMp?si=67e108db61304eb1). Tracks may also count towards multiple days assuming each is referenced in title or lyrics, such as [5th of July](https://open.spotify.com/track/2DT8KK9JK8HqPph9ZuWVn3?si=b16ad4d1d3ec49de) (which references the 4th & 5th), [DECEMBER 31ST](https://open.spotify.com/track/0YUd3iXqJA4YPhqHbPHAQ0?si=5ad935bd8db74533) (which references the 31st & 1st).

Tracks like those on [Cornell 5/8/77](https://open.spotify.com/album/3T9UKU0jMIyrRD0PtKXqPJ?si=vYIqLQQZQbCwXDC7iLm0XA) or [untitled unmastered.](https://open.spotify.com/album/0kL3TYRsSXnu0iJvFO3rud?si=sLGEjDYzQp-NnbFH5hShvA) are _not_ permitted, as the dates in their titles are simply the date of recording.

# Daysongs

Songs for specifically today!

## Criteria

In order to count as a true daysong, a track must be either:

- Named for a specific date (not simply recorded that day)
- Reference a specific date in its lyrics

Holidays (including floating ones like Easter are permitted); examples of songs that would _not_ fit the bill are, would be anything on [Cornell 5/8/77](https://open.spotify.com/album/3T9UKU0jMIyrRD0PtKXqPJ?si=vYIqLQQZQbCwXDC7iLm0XA) or [untitled unmastered.](https://open.spotify.com/album/0kL3TYRsSXnu0iJvFO3rud?si=sLGEjDYzQp-NnbFH5hShvA); while these tracks do have a date in their title, this is simply their date of recording!

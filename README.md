# Daysongs

Songs for specifically today!

## Criteria

In order to count as a true daysong, a track must either:

- Be named for a specific date (not simply recorded that day)
- Reference a specific date in its lyrics

Holidays (including floating ones like Easter) are permitted; tracks like ones on [Cornell 5/8/77](https://open.spotify.com/album/3T9UKU0jMIyrRD0PtKXqPJ?si=vYIqLQQZQbCwXDC7iLm0XA) or [untitled unmastered.](https://open.spotify.com/album/0kL3TYRsSXnu0iJvFO3rud?si=sLGEjDYzQp-NnbFH5hShvA) are not, as the dates in their titles are simply the date of recording.
